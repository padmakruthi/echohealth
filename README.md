Echo Health 🏥

Echo Health is a simple healthcare support system built to help families manage medicines safely.
We created this project after seeing how confusing prescriptions and medicine schedules can be, especially for elderly people at home.

Why Echo Health?

In many homes, medicine mistakes don’t happen because people don’t care —
they happen because:

prescriptions are hard to read

medicine names look similar

reminders are missed

instructions are confusing

This problem becomes serious when one person manages medicines for multiple family members.

What We Built

Echo Health helps users:

understand prescriptions clearly

check if the medicine they are taking is correct

follow proper medicine timings

find nearby pharmacies when needed

Our focus is on clarity and safety, not diagnosis.

Key Features
Prescription Scan

Users can scan a prescription and see simplified details like:

medicine names

basic intake instructions

The system is designed to use OCR to read text from images (simulated in this MVP).

Medicine Scan & Verification

Users can scan a medicine strip or label to:

confirm the medicine name

see the company/manufacturer

check basic intake details

This gives users confidence that they are taking the right medicine.

Smart Scheduler & Reminders

Based on the prescription, Echo Health creates a medicine schedule and reminds users to take medicines on time.
The system is designed to support voice reminders for elderly users.

Nearby Pharmacy

If a medicine is unavailable, Echo Health helps users locate nearby pharmacies using Google Maps.
